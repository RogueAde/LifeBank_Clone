# An overview of the website built.
LifeBank â„¢ is a logistics company with an awesome mission, you can check them out on Googleâ„¢ or you can check their [official website.](https://lifebankcares.com/#/home)

If you check the website above, you'll have seen what I'm supposed to be recreating lol. I used "supposed to" because I don't believe I'm good enough to recreate it perfectly. Due to the complexity of the real website it has some bugs, actually a lot of bugs so one of my end-goals was to make sure all the bugs were non-existent.

## The things I gained while on this project:
While I was building this website, I got some more insight and knowledge on some stupid stuff, not stupid actually buh you know what I mean naw...
* Live experience using SASS/SCSS.
* More knowledge on CSS esp. CSS animations.
* A taste of complex javaScript in a pure HTML/CSS project.
* A positive feedback on my whack skills(was really nice to code something up).
* The painful knowledge that "In the front-end developing world, Sodiq Sanusi is still a beginner developer".
* Using CSS architecture, BEM to be exact.



## Things I'll brush up on:
Even though I learnt some new things while on this project, I've also gotten some things I admit I don't know a whiff about. So some of those things are:
* Advanced javaScript in a website.
* Using intelligent CSS animations.
* The fact that I'm a noob(I swear that stuff is painful ðŸ˜­).

## What's next?
Now that this is over, what are you planning to do next?
> After brushing up on the things I listed down tho.

The next thing to do now is learning a javaScript framework. I'm planning to learn React.js, let's just make the jump okay?
Thanks for going through this markdown, I really appreciate your patience amd audience going through it. 
If you'll like to connect with a beginner front-end developer that is somehow intelligent (not 100% trueðŸ™‚), check me out on any social platform as "Sodiq Sanusi" or just [click this, you lazy ass.](https://www.facebook.com/sodiqsanusi0)

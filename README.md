# LifeBank_Clone
A home-page clone of a wonderful website, check "Lifebank" on Google to find out about them and their mission.

## About LifeBank

They are a logistics company that specialises in the rapid transport of blood, and urgent medical supplies. <br>
I'm trying to recreate their website homepage and hopefully send it to the CEO of the company as a goodwill gesture. <br>
I love her vision and the work she has put in creating and storing enough blood. The fact she even uses drones in her will to give the fastest logistics
solutions to the health-care sector. <br>

### Enough talk tho, let's build something beautiful Ade.
